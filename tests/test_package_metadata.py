"""The version the package reports, and the annotations it declares, are the ones it ships.

The release's verify job installs the published version from PyPI and checks that
`sigrix_launcher.__version__` names it and that `py.typed` came with it. By then the
version is spent, so both are checked here first. `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py`
each carry the number; this is what keeps them from drifting apart before a tag does.
